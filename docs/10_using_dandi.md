# Working with DANDI

DANDI provides access to an archive that stores cellular neurophysiology
datasets. We refer to such datasets as `Dandisets`.

1. A `Dandiset` is organized in a structured manner to help users and
software tools interact with it.
1. Each `Dandiset` has a unique persistent identifier that you can use to go directly
to the `Dandiset` (e.g., [https://identifiers.org/DANDI:000004](https://identifiers.org/DANDI:000004)).
You can use this identifier to cite the `Dandiset` in your publications or provide
direct access to a `Dandiset`.

## DANDI components

### The DANDI Web application

The [DANDI Web application](https://dandiarchive.org/) allows you to:

1. Browse `Dandisets`.
1. Search across `Dandisets`.
1. Create an account to register a new `Dandiset` or gain access to
[the Dandihub analysis platform](#the-dandihub-analysis-platform).
1. Add collaborators to your `Dandiset`.
1. Retrieve an `API key` to perform data upload to your `Dandisets`.
1. Publish versions of your `Dandisets`.

### The DANDI Python client

The [DANDI Python client](https://pypi.org/project/dandi/) allows you to:

1. Download `Danidsets` and individual subject folders or files.
1. Organize your data locally before upload.
1. Upload `Dandisets`.

### The Dandihub analysis platform

[Dandihub](https://hub.dandiarchive.org) provides a Jupyter environment to
interact with the DANDI archive. To use the hub, you will need to register an
account using [the DANDI Web application](#the-dandi-web-application). Please
note that `Dandihub` is not intended for significant computation, but provides a
place to introspect `Dandisets` and files.

## Downloading from DANDI

You can download entire `Dandisets` or single files.

### Downloading a file

#### Using the Web application

Each `Dandiset` has a `View Data` option. This provides a folder-like view to
navigate a `Dandiset`. Any file in the `Dandiset` has a download icon next to it.
You can click this icon to download a file to your device where you are browsing
or right click to get the download URL of the file. You can then use this URL
programmatically or in other applications such as the [NWB Explorer](https://nwbexplorer.opensourcebrain.org/)
or in a [Jupyter notebook on Dandihub](https://hub.dandiarchive.org).

#### Using the Python CLI

First install the Python client using `pip install dandi` in a Python 3.6+
environment.

1. Downloading a `Dandiset`, e.g.:

`dandi download https://identifiers.org/DANDI:000004`

1. Downloading a subject.
1. Downloading a file.

## Create an account on DANDI

To create an account on DANDI, you will need to.

1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/) if you don't have one.
1. Using your Github account [register a DANDI account](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/user/register).
1. You will receive an email acknowledging activation of your account within 24
hours. You can now login to DANDI using the Github by clicking on the login
button.

## Uploading a Dandiset

1. Setup
    - If you do not have a DANDI account, please [create an account](#create-an-account-on-dandi)
    - Log in to DANDI and copy your API key. This is under your user initials on the
    top right after logging in.
    - Locally
        - Create a Python environment (e.g., Miniconda, virtualenv)
        - Install the DANDI CLI into your Python environment

            `pip install "dandi>=0.6.0"`
        - **Make sure you have version 0.6.0 or higher**    

1. Data upload/management workflow
    1. Register a dandiset to generate an identifier. You will be asked to enter
      basic metadata, a name (title) and description (abstract) for your dataset.
      Click `New Dataset` in the Web application after logging in. After you are
      done, note the dataset identifer. We will call this `<dataset_id>`.
    1. Convert your data to NWB 2.1+ in a local folder. Let's call this `<source_folder>`
    This step can be complex depending on your data. Feel free to [reach out to
    us for help](../#where-to-communicate).
    1. Validate the NWB files by running: `dandi validate <source_folder>`
    1. Preparing a dataset folder for upload:
        1. `dandi download https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/<dataset_id>/draft`
        1. `cd <dataset_id>`
        1. `dandi organize <source_folder> -f dry`
        1. `dandi organize <source_folder> -f symlink`
        1. `dandi upload`
    1. Add metadata on the Web. Click on the `Edit metadata` link by visiting
    your dandiset landing page: `https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/<dataset_id>/draft`
    1. Use the dandiset URL in your preprint directly, or download it using the dandi CLI:
            `dandi download <dandiset_url>`
