Overview: Publishing datasets
-----------------------------

The sections :ref:`yoda_project`, :ref:`sharethirdparty`, and :ref:`gin` have each
shown you crucial aspects of the functions of dataset publishing with
:command:`datalad push`. This section wraps them all together.

The general overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:command:`datalad push` is the command to turn to when you want to publish datasets.
It is capable of publishing all dataset content, i.e., files stored in :term:`Git`,
and files stored with :term:`git-annex`, to a known dataset :term:`sibling`.

.. gitusernote::

   The :command:`datalad push` uses ``git push``, and ``git annex copy`` under
   the hood. Publication targets need to either be configured remote Git repositories,
   or git-annex special remotes (if they support data upload).

In order to publish a dataset, the dataset needs to have a sibling to push to.
This, for instance, can be a :term:`GitHub`, :term:`GitLab`, or :term:`Gin`
repository, but it can also be a Remote Indexed Archive (RIA) store for backup
or storage of datasets [#f1]_, or a regular clone [#f2]_.

.. findoutmore:: all of the ways to configure siblings

   - Add an existing repository as a sibling with the :command:`datalad siblings`
     command. Here is an example::

        $ datalad siblings add --name github-repo --url <url.to.github>

   - Create a sibling from scratch, right from within your repository:
     This can be done with the commands :command:`create-sibling-github` (for GitHub)
     or :command:`create-siblings-gitlab` (for GitLab), or
     :command:`create-sibling-ria` (for a remote indexed archive dataset store [#f1]_).
     Note that :command:`create-sibling-ria` can add an existing store as a sibling
     or create a new one from scratch

In order to publish dataset content, DataLad needs to know to which sibling
content shall be pushed. This can be specified with the ``--to`` option directly
from the command line::

   $ datalad push --to <sibling>

If you have more than one :term:`branch` in your dataset, note that a
:command:`datalad push` command will by default update all branches that both
the sibling and the dataset share. If such advanced aspects of pushing are
relevant for your workflow, please check out the hidden section at the end of
this paragraph.

By default, :command:`push` will make the last saved state of the dataset
available. Consequently, if the sibling is in the same state as the dataset,
no push is attempted.
Additionally, :command:`push` will attempt to automatically decide what type
of dataset contents are going to be published. With a sibling that has a
:term:`special remote` configured as a :term:`publication dependency`,
or a sibling that contains an annex (such as a Gin repository or a
:term:`Remote Indexed Archive (RIA) store`), both the contents
stored in Git (i.e., a dataset's history) as well as file contents stored in
git-annex will be published.

Alternatively, one can enforce particular operations or push a subset of dataset
contents. For one, when specifying a path in the :command:`datalad push` command,
only data or changes for those paths are considered for a push.
Additionally, one can select a particular mode of operation with the ``-f/--force``
option. Several different modes are possible:

- ``no-datatransfer``: With this option, annexed contents are not published. This
  means that the sibling will have information on the annexed files' names, but
  file contents will not be available, and thus ``datalad get`` calls in the
  sibling would fail.
- ``datatransfer``: With this option, the underlying ``git annex copy`` call to
  publish file contents is evoked without a ``--fast`` option. Usually, the
  ``--fast`` option increases the speed of the operation, as it disables a check
  whether the sibling already has content. This however, might skip copying content
  in some cases. Therefore, ``--force datatransfer`` is a slower, but more fail-safe
  option to publish annexed file contents.
- ``gitpush``: This option triggers a ``git push --force``. Be very careful using
  this option - it will push all branches that are known to the sibling, and if
  the changes on these branches are conflicting with the changes that exist in
  the sibling, the changes that exist in the sibling will be overwritten.
- ``all``: The final mode, ``all``, combines modes ``gitpush`` and ``datatransfer``,
  thus attempting to really get your dataset contents published.

.. findoutmore:: Details on push for Gitusers

   The commands :command:`git push` and :command:`datalad push` appear similar,
   but there are crucial differences between them. Depending on how well you
   know Git, and how complex your DataLad workflows are, you should be aware of
   them to pick the correct command for your use case.

   If you have more than one :term:`branch` in your dataset, a
   :command:`datalad push --to <sibling>` will update all branches that the
   sibling already has. In other words, :command:`push` honors Git's
   configuration of upstream branches, so whenever there is any branch
   configured for push, it will push those, and all of them.
   If you only want to push a single branch, you will need
   to `configure push targets <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push>`_ , or use
   :command:`git push <sibling> <branch>`/
   :command:`git push -u <sibling> <branch>` syntax.





Setting access control via publishing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a number of ways to restrict access to your dataset or individual
files of your dataset. One is via choice of (third party) hosting service
for annexed file contents.
If you chose a service only selected people have access to, and publish annexed
contents exclusively there, then only those selected people can perform a
successful :command:`datalad get`. On shared file systems you may achieve
this via :term:`permissions` for certain groups or users, and for third party
infrastructure you may achieve this by invitations/permissions/... options
of the respective service.

If it is individual files that you do not want to share, you can selectively
publish the contents of all files you want others to have, and withhold the data
of the files you do not want to share. This can be done by publishing only
selected files by providing paths, or overriding default push behavior with
the ``-f/--force`` option. In the latter case, specifying ``-f no-datatransfer``
would for example not push any annexed contents.

Let's say you have a dataset with three files:

- ``experiment.txt``
- ``subject_1.dat``
- ``subject_2.dat``

Consider that all of these files are annexed. While the information in
``experiment.txt`` is fine for everyone to see, ``subject_1.dat`` and
``subject_2.dat`` contain personal and potentially identifying data that
can not be shared. Nevertheless, you want collaborators to know that these
files exist. The use case

.. todo::

  Write use case "external researcher without data access"

details such a scenario and demonstrates how external collaborators (with whom data
can not be shared) can develop scripts against the directory structure and
file names of a dataset, submit those scripts to the data owners, and thus still perform an
analysis despite not having access to the data.

By publishing only the file contents of ``experiment.txt`` with

.. code-block:: bash

  $ datalad push --to github experiment.txt

only meta data about file availability of ``subject_1.dat`` and ``subject_2.dat``
exists, but as these files' annexed data is not published, a :command:`datalad get`
will fail. Note, though, that :command:`push` will publish the complete
dataset history (unless you specify a commit range with the ``--since`` option
-- see the `manual <http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-push.html>`_
for more information).


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1]  RIA siblings are filesystem-based, scalable storage solutions for
          DataLad datasets. You can find out more about them in the usecase
          :ref:`usecase_datastore`.

.. [#f2] If you are unfamiliar with Git, please be aware that cloning a dataset
         to a different place and subsequently pushing to it can lead to Git
         error messages if changes are pushed to a currently checked out
         :term:`branch` of the sibling (in technical Git terms: When pushing to
         a checked-out branch of a non-bare repository remote).
         As an example, consider what happens
         if we attempt a :command:`datalad push` to the sibling ``roommate``
         that we created in the chapter :ref:`chapter_collaboration`:

         .. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-141-101
            :language: console
            :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

            $ datalad push --to roommate

         Publishing fails with the error message
         ``[remote rejected] (branch is currently checked out)``.
         This can be prevented with
         `configuration settings <https://github.blog/2015-02-06-git-2-3-has-been-released/>`_
         in Git versions 2.3 or higher, or by pushing to a branch of the sibling
         that is currently not checked-out.
