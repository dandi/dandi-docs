# DANDI Archive Project Governance

Version: 1.0  
Effective Date: YYYY-MM-DD  
Status: Draft

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the governance structure, roles, responsibilities, and decision‑making processes for the DANDI Archive ecosystem. It applies uniformly to all current and future repositories and services, including:

Sites:
- https://dandiarchive.org
- https://hub.dandiarchive.org
- https://about.dandiarchive.org

Code repositories:
- https://github.com/dandi
- https://github.com/dandisets
- https://github.com/dandizarrs

## 2. Mission

DANDI (Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration) enables FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) publishing, preservation, discovery, and computational reuse of neurophysiology data.  DANDI provides:

- A cloud-based platform to store, process, and disseminate data. You can use DANDI to collaborate and publish datasets.
- Open access to data to enable secondary uses of data outside the intent of the study.
- Optimize data storage and access through partnerships, compression and accessibility technologies.
- Enables reproducible practices and publications through data standards such as NWB and BIDS.
- The platform is not just an endpoint to dump data, it is intended as a living repository that enables collaboration within and across labs.

## 3. Core Principles

1. Openness & Transparency: Designs, discussions, and decisions are public by default
2. FAIR & Reproducibility: Data and code evolution remain traceable and citable
3. Sustainability: Architectural and process decisions consider long-term maintainability
4. Inclusivity & Respect: Guided by a Code of Conduct
5. Stewardship: Authority derives from consistent, high‑quality contribution
6. Accountability: Roles carry explicit responsibilities
7. Security & Privacy: Responsible handling of sensitive data and credentials

    - Approve or amend governance document and Code of Conduct
    - Strategic project oversight
    - Resolve escalated disputes
    - Approve major architectural shifts

## 6. Decision-Making Model

### 6.1 Roadmap
- Project targets are discussed during the biweekly Engineering Core and Scientific Core meetings.
- Project Leadership provides guidance on prioritization of targets.
- Public notes of these meetings are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-jXLpcrh3L650FiZyTFgcs096nZjO2C3).

### 6.2 Consensus Process
1. Open a GitHub issue describing the bug/feature request, context, and possible solutions.
2. For major architectural changes, create a design document.  For reference, see [previous design documents](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-archive/tree/master/doc).
3. Collect feedback during a 7 day review period.
4. Summarize consensus in the GitHub issue and resolve all suggestions in the design document.
5. Implement via pull request(s) referencing the proposed design.

### 6.3 Conflict of Interest
- Participants should disclose direct commercial interest in a technology choice.
- Conflicted member recuses oneself from final decision phase.

## 7. Pull Request Workflow

### 7.1 Pull Request Requirements
- Link the associated issue
- Add a clear description (problem, approach, alternatives considered)
- Major architectural changes require a design document
- Add or update tests
- Update documentation
- Ensure CI passes
- Large pull requests should be split unless justified
- No introduction of unreviewed secrets or credentials
- Verified provenance for large binary additions (discouraged in code repos)

### 7.2 Merge Policy
- All pull requests require:
    - All comments must be resolved or addressed
    - Approval by at least 1 listed Maintainer for that repository
    - 24 hour waiting period (unless addressing a critical issue)
- See section below regarding updates to the Governance document

### 7.3 Draft vs Ready for Review
- Open as a Draft for early feedback
- Convert to “Ready” only when tests and documentation are updated

### 7.4 Reverts
- Any Maintainer may revert a merged pull request causing regression, security issue, or service degradation, with immediate notice in original pull request thread.
- Follow-up issue required to track remediation

## 8. Releases

### 8.1 Versioning
- Semantic Versioning for APIs and libraries

### 8.2 Release Steps
- For [dandi-archive](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-archive), once a pull request is merged the changes are deployed to the sandbox environment (https://sandbox.dandiarchive.org) for review and testing prior to release.
- New releases are created with a GitHub Actions workflow built around [`auto`](https://github.com/intuit/auto).
- When a pull request is merged that has the "`release`" label, `auto`:
  - Updates the changelog based on the pull requests since the last release and commits the results
  - Tags the new commit with the next version number
  - Creates a GitHub release for the tag
- For [dandi-cli](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli), upon release a new version is published to PyPI

## 9. Security

### 9.1 Reporting
- Security reports via help@dandiarchive.org
- Acknowledge within 48 hours

### 9.2 Handling
- Initial assessment within 5 business days
- Coordinate and address issue within 30 days
- User advisory via email when appropriate

### 9.3 Hardening Practices
- Mandatory dependency scanning
- Principle of least privilege enforced for service accounts
