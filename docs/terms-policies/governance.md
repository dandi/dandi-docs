# DANDI Archive Project Governance

Version: 1.0  
Effective Date: YYYY-MM-DD  
Status: Draft

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the governance structure, roles, responsibilities, and decision‑making processes for the DANDI Archive ecosystem. It applies uniformly to all current and future repositories and services, including:

Sites:
- https://dandiarchive.org
- https://hub.dandiarchive.org
- https://about.dandiarchive.org

Code repositories:
- https://github.com/dandi
- https://github.com/dandisets
- https://github.com/dandizarrs

## 2. Mission

DANDI (Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration) enables FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) publishing, preservation, discovery, and computational reuse of neurophysiology data.  DANDI provides:

- A cloud-based platform to store, process, and disseminate data. You can use DANDI to collaborate and publish datasets.
- Open access to data to enable secondary uses of data outside the intent of the study.
- Optimize data storage and access through partnerships, compression and accessibility technologies.
- Enables reproducible practices and publications through data standards such as NWB and BIDS.
- The platform is not just an endpoint to dump data, it is intended as a living repository that enables collaboration within and across labs.

## 3. Core Principles

1. Openness & Transparency: Designs, discussions, and decisions are public by default
2. FAIR & Reproducibility: Data and code evolution remain traceable and citable
3. Sustainability: Architectural and process decisions consider long-term maintainability
4. Inclusivity & Respect: Guided by a Code of Conduct
5. Stewardship: Authority derives from consistent, high‑quality contribution
6. Accountability: Roles carry explicit responsibilities
7. Security & Privacy: Responsible handling of sensitive data and credentials
