# Publishing Dandisets

Once you create a Dandiset, DANDI will automatically create a `draft` version of the Dandiset that 
can be 
changed as many times as needed. 

Prior to publishing, you should edit your metadata appropriately
(e.g. people and funding contributors, protocol information, keywords, related resources in other 
sources such as publications, code repositories, and other data).
If you need to change the Dandiset or its metadata in the future, you will need to create another version of your 
Dandiset. The content of the specific published version of the Dandiset cannot be changed.

When you are ready to publish your data and to create a unique version of your 
Dandiset, click the `Publish` button (on the right panel of the landing page). Note that the `Publish` 
button is only active if all the metadata and asset errors are fixed.
