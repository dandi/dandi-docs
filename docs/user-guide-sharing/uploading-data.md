# Uploading Data

This page provides instructions for uploading data to DANDI after you have [created a Dandiset](./creating-dandiset.md) and [converted your data to NWB format](./converting-data/index.md).

## Prerequisites

Before uploading data to DANDI, ensure you have:

1. [Created a Dandiset](./creating-dandiset.md) on DANDI
2. [Converted your data to NWB format](./converting-data/index.md)
3. [Validated your NWB files](./validating-files.md) to ensure they meet DANDI's requirements
4. Installed the [DANDI Client](https://pypi.org/project/dandi/):
   ```bash
   pip install -U dandi
   ```
5. Set up your API key (see [Storing Access Credentials](#storing-access-credentials) below)

## Technical limitations

- **File name/path:** There is a limit of 512 characters for the full path length within a dandiset.
- **Volume and size:** There is a limit of 5TB per file. We currently
  accept any size of standardized datasets, as long as you can upload them over
  an HTTPS connection. However, we ask you contact us if you plan to upload more than 10TB of data.

## Upload Methods

DANDI provides two main methods for uploading data:

### 1. Using NWB GUIDE

The NWB GUIDE provides a graphical interface for uploading data to DANDI. See the [NWB GUIDE Dataset Publication Tutorial](https://nwb-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dataset_publication.html) for more information.

### 2. Using the DANDI CLI

For command-line users or those with larger datasets, the DANDI CLI provides a powerful way to upload data:

1. **Download the Dandiset locally**
   ```bash
   dandi download https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/<dataset_id>/draft
   cd <dataset_id>
   ```
2. **Organize your data** (skip this step if you are preparing a proper [BIDS dataset](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) with e.g. OME-Zarr, NWB and other files):
   ```bash
   dandi organize <source_folder> -f dry  # Dry run to see what would happen
   dandi organize <source_folder>         # Actually organize the files
   ```
3. **Validate your data**
   ```bash
   dandi validate .
   ```
4. **Upload your data**
   ```bash
   dandi upload
   ```
   To upload to the development server, use:
   ```bash
   dandi upload -i dandi-sandbox
   ```

## Storing Access Credentials

There are two options for storing your DANDI access credentials:

### 1. `DANDI_API_KEY` Environment Variable

- By default, the DANDI CLI looks for an API key in the `DANDI_API_KEY` environment variable. To set this on Linux or macOS, run:

  ```bash
  export DANDI_API_KEY=personal-key-value
  ```

- Note that there are no spaces around the "=".

- If your `DANDI_API_KEY` needs to be reset (for example, because it was publicly exposed), you can cycle your API key by following the instructions below:

   1. Log in to DANDI Archive
   2. Click on your user initials in the top-right corner
   3. Click the circular arrow
   ![dandi_api_key_reset](../img/dandi_api_key_reset.png)

### 2. `keyring` Library

If the `DANDI_API_KEY` environment variable is not set, the CLI will look up the API key using the [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) library, which supports numerous backends, including the system keyring, an encrypted keyfile, and a plaintext (unencrypted) keyfile.

**Specifying the `keyring` backend**:
You can set the backend the `keyring` library uses either by setting the `PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND` environment variable or by filling in the `keyring` library's [configuration file](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring#configuring).
  IDs for the available backends can be listed by running `keyring --list`.
If no backend is specified, the library will use the available backend with the highest priority.

**Storing the API key with `keyring`**:
You can store your API key where the `keyring` library can find it by using the `keyring` program: Run `keyring set dandi-api-dandi key` and enter the API key when asked for the password for `key` in `dandi-api-dandi`.
If the API key isn't stored in either the `DANDI_API_KEY` environment variable or in the keyring, the CLI will prompt you to enter the API key, and then it will store it in the keyring.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the upload process:

- Ensure your NWB files pass validation (see [Validating NWB Files](./validating-files.md))
- Check that you're using the latest versions of `dandi`, `PyNWB`, and `MatNWB`

If you continue to have issues, please reach out via the [DANDI Help Desk](https://github.com/dandi/helpdesk/discussions).


## Debugging the DANDI CLI

If something goes wrong while using the Python CLI client, the
first place to check for more information so that you can [file a quality bug
report](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues) is the logs.  Every command records a copy of its logs in a logfile, the location of which is
reported to the user when the command finishes running.  The location of the
logs varies by platform, e.g.:

- Linux: `~/.cache/dandi-cli/log` or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/dandi-cli/log`
- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/dandi-cli`

Logs are named with a combination of the time at which the `dandi` command
started running and the process ID of the command.

Recent versions of the client include all possible debugging information in the
logs, but if you're using an older version, only log messages that were printed
to the user when the command ran are recorded.  As a result, in order to get
complete debugging information, you may have to rerun the problematic command,
this time increasing the logging level by passing `-l DEBUG` or `--log-level
DEBUG` on the command line.  Note that this option goes between the main
`dandi` command and the name of the subcommand:

    # Right:
    dandi -l DEBUG upload

    # Wrong:
    dandi upload -l DEBUG

In addition, many commands can be put into a developer-specific mode for
showing raw progress information instead of fancy progress bars.  For the
`delete`, `organize`, `upload`, and `validate` commands, this can be done by
setting the `DANDI_DEVEL` environment variable and passing `--devel-debug` to
the command:

    DANDI_DEVEL=1 dandi upload --devel-debug

For the `download` command, the equivalent is the `-f debug`/`--format debug`
option:

    dandi download -f debug

More advanced users who are familiar with [the Python
debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) can instruct the client to
automatically open the debugger if any errors occur by supplying the `--pdb`
option to the command.  Like the `-l`/`--log-level` option, the `--pdb` option
must be placed between `dandi` and the name of the subcommand.
