## DANDI Style Guidelines

Follow the guidelines below when creating and revising text in the DANDI Handbook:

*	**dandi-** repositories — hyphenate the names of DANDI GitHub repositories (e.g. **dandi-archive**); "Dandisets" is an exception because it is a
complete word
*	**Dandiset**  — use single, unformatted, capitalized word (**not** dandiset or `Dandiset`)
*	file names — use lower case (e.g. **development.md**)
*	headings — use Title Capitalization (for 1st and 2nd levels) and follow with an intro sentence
*	**GitHub** — use camel case (**not** github or Github)
*	instructional language — should be direct, imperative, active, straightforward (e.g. "Install the files in your Python environment", *not* "Files could be installed in your Python environment")
*	**JupyterHub** — use camel case (**not** Jupyterhub)
*	**license** (**not** licence); in general, prefer American spelling
*	limited use of "please"
*	steps should start with 1, not 0
